# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, 
as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. 
Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 
You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. 
To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, 
and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Datasets Used

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Logs Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. 
These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

Our fact table is going to be the Table Songplays wich are records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

**Table songplays**

| COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   songplay_id	| SERIAL  	|   PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   start_time	|   TIMESTAMP	|   	| 
|   user_id	|   INT	|   	| 
|   level	|   TEXT |   	| 
|   song_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   artist_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   session_id	|   INT	|   	| 
|   location	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   user_agent	|   TEXT	|   	| 

Them we create one table for each dimension table for the **Fact Table**
 
 **Table users** 
 
 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   user_id	| SERIAL  	|   PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   first_name	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   last_name	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   gender	|   TEXT |   	| 
|   level	|   TEXT	|   	| 

**Table songs**

 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   song_id	| TEXT  	|   PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   title	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   artist_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   year	|   INT |   	| 
|   duration	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 

**Table artists**

 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   artist_id	| TEXT  	|   PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   name	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   location	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   latitude	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 
|   longitude	|   NUMERIC |   	| 

**Table time**
 
 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   start_time	| TIMESTAMP  	|   PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   hour	|   INT	|   	| 
|   day	|   INT	|   	| 
|   week	|   INT	|   	| 
|   month	|   INT	|   	| 
|   year	|   INT	|   	| 
|   weekday	|   TEXT	|   	| 

## Project Template

Files used on the project:
1. **data** folder where all needed data in jsons forms are stored.
2. **sql_queries.py** contains all sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
3. **create_tables.py** drops and creates tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
4. **test.ipynb** displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
5. **etl.ipynb** python notebook to do Experimental ETL in single rows of the dataset 
6. **etl.py** final ETL file to execute and process all data from the files 

## Steps to run the Project

1ยบ Create de tables in the database executing the create_tables.py file running the command in the terminal:
 ```
python create_tables.py
```

2ยบ Run the ETL python file etl.py next:
 ```
python etl.py
```

3ยบ Use the test.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to verify that all tables were created and if certify that the data was inserted
