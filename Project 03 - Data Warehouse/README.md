# Project: Data Warehouse

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, we'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. We will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Datasets Used

We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Logs Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. 
These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Staging Tables

First we create two stagings tables to insert all the JSON data in redshift, then we use this tables to load the data in the format that we need for the Star Schema that we modeled.

**Table staging_events**

| COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   artist	| TEXT  	|   	| 
|   auth	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   firstName	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   gender	|   TEXT |   	| 
|   itemInSession	|   INT	|   	| 
|   lastName	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   length	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 
|   location	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   method	|   TEXT	|   	|
|   page	|   TEXT	|   	|
|   registration	|   NUMERIC	|   	|
|   sessionId	|   INT	|   	|
|   song	|   TEXT	|   	|
|   status	|   INT	|   	|
|   ts	|   TIMESTAMP	|   	|
|   userAgent	|   TEXT	|   	|
|   userId	|   INT	|   	|


**Table staging_songs**

| COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   num_songs	| INT  	|   	| 
|   artist_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   artist_latitude	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 
|   artist_longitude	|   NUMERIC |   	| 
|   artist_name	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   song_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   title	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   duration	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 
|   year	|   INT	|   	|


## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

Our fact table is going to be the Table Songplays wich are records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong.

**Table songplays**

| COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   songplay_id	| INT  	|   IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   start_time	|   TIMESTAMP	|  NOT NULL SORTKEY 	| 
|   user_id	|   INT	|  NOT NULL DISTKEY 	| 
|   level	|   TEXT |   	| 
|   song_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   artist_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   session_id	|   INT	|   	| 
|   location	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   user_agent	|   TEXT	|   	| 

Them we create one table for each dimension table for the **Fact Table**
 
 **Table users** 
 
 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   user_id	| INT  	|   IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY DISTKEY	| 
|   first_name	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   last_name	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   gender	|   TEXT |   	| 
|   level	|   TEXT	|   	| 

**Table songs**

 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   song_id	| TEXT  	|   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   title	|   TEXT	|  	| 
|   artist_id	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   year	|   INT |   	| 
|   duration	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 

**Table artists**

 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   artist_id	| TEXT  	|   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY	| 
|   name	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   location	|   TEXT	|   	| 
|   latitude	|   NUMERIC	|   	| 
|   longitude	|   NUMERIC |   	| 

**Table time**
 
 | COLUMN  	| TYPE  	| CONSTRAINT   	|
|---	|---	|---	|	
|   start_time	| TIMESTAMP  	|   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY SORTKEY	| 
|   hour	|   INT	|   	| 
|   day	|   INT	|   	| 
|   week	|   INT	|   	| 
|   month	|   INT	|   	| 
|   year	|   INT	|   	| 
|   weekday	|   TEXT	|   	| 

## Project Template

Files used on the project:
1. **create_tables.py** drops and creates tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
2. **sql_queries.py** contains all sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
3. **etl.py** final ETL file to execute and process all ingest and transformations in SQL. 
4. **IaC.ipynb** python notebook to create the resources in AWS (IAM, Redshift Cluster, Security Groups) using Infrastructure as Code.
5. We also need a **dhw.cfg** file that is not in this repository containing the following variables to reference the s3 buckets and the variables of the redshift cluster:

```
[CLUSTER]
HOST=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=5439

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN=

[S3]
LOG_DATA=s3://udacity-dend/log_data
LOG_JSONPATH=s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
SONG_DATA=s3://udacity-dend/song_data

[AWS]
KEY=
SECRET=

[DWH]
DWH_IAM_ROLE_NAME      = 
DWH_CLUSTER_TYPE       = multi-node
DWH_NODE_TYPE          = dc2.large
DWH_NUM_NODES          = 4
DWH_DB                 = 
DWH_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER = 
DWH_DB_USER            = 
DWH_DB_PASSWORD        = 
DWH_PORT               = 5439
```
## Steps to run the Project

1º Setup the dwh.cfg file in the root folder.

2º Execute the following steps in the IaC jupyter notebook to create the AWS resources.

3º Create the staging tables in the redshift cluster executing the create_tables.py file running the command in the terminal:
```
python create_tables.py
```

4º Run the ETL python file etl.py next:
```
python etl.py
```

5º Execute some queries in Query Editor in AWS Redshift console to test the inserted rows, like:

`SELECT * from time limit 10`

`SELECT count(user_id) from users`
