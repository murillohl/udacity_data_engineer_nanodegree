# Project: Data Lake

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

We are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Datasets Used

We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Logs Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. 
These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets as the source data, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

Our fact table is going to be the Table Songplays wich are records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong.

**Table songplays** - Partition By year, month
```
 |-- start_time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- userId: string (nullable = true)
 |-- level: string (nullable = true)
 |-- sessionId: long (nullable = true)
 |-- location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- userAgent: string (nullable = true)
 |-- song_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- songplay_id: long (nullable = false)
```

Them we create one table for each dimension table for the **Fact Table**
 
 **Table users** 
 ```
 |-- firstName: string (nullable = true)
 |-- lastName: string (nullable = true)
 |-- gender: string (nullable = true)
 |-- level: string (nullable = true)
 |-- userId: string (nullable = true)
```

**Table songs** - Partition By year, artist_id
```
 |-- song_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- title: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- year: long (nullable = true)
 |-- duration: double (nullable = true)
```

**Table artists**

```
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_latitude: double (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_longitude: double (nullable = true)
```

**Table time** - Partition By year, month
 ```
 |-- start_time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- hour: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- day: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- week: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- month: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- year: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- weekday: integer (nullable = true)
```

## Project Template

Files used on the project:
1. **etl.py** ETL file to execute and process all ingest and transformations process between S3.
2. S3 buckets containing the json files provided by Udacity
3. We also need a **dl.cfg** file that is not in this repository containing AWS IAM credentials to write in your s3 bucket

```

[AWS]
KEY=
SECRET=

```
## Steps to run the Project

1ยบ Setup the dl.cfg file in the root folder.

2ยบ Configure the variables of output s3 files path in the main() function.

3ยบ Run the ETL python file etl.py next:
```
python etl.py
```
